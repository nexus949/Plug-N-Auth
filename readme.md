## Overview
**Plug-N-Auth** is an _‚Äúalmost‚Äù_ stateless **Authentication API** designed to help developers integrate secure user authentication without reinventing the wheel. Instead of building an entire authentication system from scratch, Plug-N-Auth offers a simple, drop-in solution via RESTful endpoints.

The API supports essential authentication flows such as user registration, login, data updates, and account deletion ‚Äî all powered by secure and scalable technology like **JWT**, **Argon2**, and **MongoDB**. The system is designed with **modularity**, **security**, and **ease of use** in mind.

### Why ‚Äúalmost‚Äù stateless?

While Plug-N-Auth uses **JWTs** (JSON Web Tokens) to maintain stateless sessions, it includes a version check stored in the database. When a JWT is sent, the system verifies that its version matches the one stored for the user. This ensures tokens can be invalidated making the system secure ‚Äî but not entirely stateless.

### Core Concepts

#### User Identity: `userEmail + serviceName`

**Plug-N-Auth** uses the combination of `userEmail` and `serviceName` to uniquely identify users. This allows the same email to be used across multiple apps or services without conflict ‚Äî enabling true **multi-service support**.

For example:

- `alice@example.com` under `service1` and `service2` will be treated as **two separate accounts**.

This also means developers can build different products using **Plug-N-Auth** as a shared auth layer, with scoped identities per service.

### Passing `serviceName` Implicitly

To improve user experience, Developers can allow the `serviceName` to be passed implicitly in the request body rather than taking an input from user.

## ‚úÖ Why Use Plug-N-Auth?

- ‚ö° **Quick integration** ‚Äì Set up auth in minutes via REST APIs.

- üõ°Ô∏è **Secure by default** ‚Äì JWT-based auth, Argon2 password hashing, versioned token invalidation.

- üîÑ **Multi-service support** ‚Äì Easily isolate user sessions between products or services.

- üß© **Modular** ‚Äì Use only the endpoints you need.

- üí¨ **Clear feedback** ‚Äì All endpoints provide structured success/error messages.

## Endpoints
Plug-N-Auth exposes a set of RESTful endpoints that allow you to perform essential authentication-related operations ‚Äî like signing up, logging in, updating user details, and deleting accounts.

Each endpoint is designed to be **minimal**, **stateless**, and **predictable**. Most requests involve sending the required fields via JSON in the request body. Endpoints that involve user-specific actions (like updating data) require a valid **JWT token** passed in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

### üöÄ Usage Pattern

- Use `POST` for creating resources (sign-up, login).

- Use `GET` for fetching the authenticated user's status.

- Use `PUT` for updates (email, password, or other fields).

- Use `DELETE` to permanently remove the user.

| **Purpose**             | **Method** | **Endpoint**           | **Parameters**                                                            | **Notes**                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Log in a user**       | `POST`     | `/user/v1/login`       | `{ userEmail, password, serviceName }`                                    | Returns JWT token if credentials are valid   |
| **Register a new user** | `POST`     | `/user/v1/signup`      | `{ userEmail, password, serviceName }`Optional: `{ firstName, lastName }` | Creates user and returns JWT token           |
| **Get user status**     | `GET`      | `/user/v1/status`      | JWT passed as Bearer Token                                                | Validates token and returns user status      |
| **Update user fields**  | `PUT`      | `/user/v1/update`      | Body: `{ fieldToUpdate }`, `{ password }`JWT in Bearer Token              | Cannot update password or email here         |
| **Update email**        | `PUT`      | `/user/v1/updateEmail` | `{ newUserEmail, password }`JWT in Bearer Token                           | Use only for email change                    |
| **Update password**     | `PUT`      | `/user/v1/updatePass`  | `{ oldPassword, newPassword, confNewPassword }`JWT in Bearer Token        | Use only for password change                 |
| **Delete user account** | `DELETE`   | `/user/v1/deleteUser`  | `{ password }`JWT in Bearer Token                                         | Irreversible ‚Äì permanently deletes user data |

Below given is an example of how to hit a endpoint using `JavaScript`:
```js
async function update(body, token){

    let response = await fetch("https://plug-n-auth.onrender.com/user/v1/update",{
        method: "put",
        headers: {
            "Authorization": `Bearer ${ token }`, //JWT sent as bearer token
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(body)
    });

    try{
        let jsonResponse = await response.json();
        console.log(jsonResponse);
    }
    catch(error){
        console.log(error);
    }
}

update(body, token);
```

These endpoints form the core of **Plug-N-Auth‚Äôs** functionality. You can interact with any of them using standard `HTTP` requests from your frontend, as demonstrated above.

## Fields
Each endpoint expects specific fields in the request body or headers. This section outlines all the fields used across **Plug-N-Auth**, along with their purpose, type, and additional notes.

### Commonly Used Fields

| Field Name        | Type   | Required                    | Description                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `userEmail`       | String | ‚úÖ Yes                       | The user‚Äôs unique email. Paired with `serviceName` to identify a user. |
| `password`        | String | ‚úÖ Yes                       | The user‚Äôs plain-text password (hashed on backend using Argon2).       |
| `serviceName`     | String | ‚úÖ Yes                       | Identifies the app/service the user is signing into.                   |
| `firstName`       | String | ‚ùå No                        | Optional field to store user‚Äôs first name.                             |
| `lastName`        | String | ‚ùå No                        | Optional field to store user‚Äôs last name.                              |
| `newUserEmail`    | String | ‚úÖ Yes (for email update)    | The new email address for the user.                                    |
| `oldPassword`     | String | ‚úÖ Yes (for password update) | The current password before change.                                    |
| `newPassword`     | String | ‚úÖ Yes (for password update) | The new password user wants to set.                                    |
| `confNewPassword` | String | ‚úÖ Yes (for password update) | Confirmation of new password to avoid mismatches.                      |
| `Authorization`   | String | ‚úÖ Yes (header)              | Bearer token (JWT) required for secured endpoints.                     |

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Field Behavior Notes

- **`userEmail + serviceName`**: This combination ensures the same email can be used for different services independently (like `plug-n-auth@xyz.com` for `service1` and `service2`).

- **`serviceName` is mandatory** and passed implicitly by the client. It helps isolate users per project.

- **JWT versioning** is used for stateless auth. Any sensitive update invalidates old tokens by changing the version in DB.

- All passwords are stored hashed using **Argon2**.

 Bearer tokens must be included in the `Authorization` header as:
 ```makefile
 Authorization: Bearer <your-token-here>
```

## Additional Information
### üîê Token Handling

- All tokens are **JWTs** (JSON Web Tokens) signed using a secure secret.

- Each token includes a `version` field. If the user's version changes (due to email/password update or critical info change), **previous tokens become invalid**, ensuring better security.


---

### üì¶ Statelessness & DB Design

- **Plug-N-Auth is _almost_ stateless**: the server doesn't store sessions; instead, each JWT includes necessary identity claims and is verified on each request.

- The database stores a versioned user feild. Only minimal data is retained, with sensitive fields (like passwords) always hashed.

---

### ‚è≥ Token Expiry

- JWTs issued by **Plug-N-Auth** have a default expiry of **30 minutes**.

- After expiry, the client must log in again to obtain a new token.

---

### ‚ùó Error Handling

- Meaningful error Handling is performed to ensure seamless User Experience.

- All errors are handled and returned as a `JSON` response with meaningful messages.

- HTTP status codes are meaningful (e.g., `401 Unauthorized`, `400 Bad Request`, `500 Internal Server Error`).
